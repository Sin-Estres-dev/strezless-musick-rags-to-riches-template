In the heart of his journey, Omar Orrantia, known to his growing fanbase as Sin Estres, embarked on an ambitious venture to start a new music label, armed not with formal education but with a treasure trove of life experiences and a passion for storytelling through melody. At just fourteen, following the heartbreaking loss of his mother, he found himself spiraling into a deep depression, grappling with a profound sense of loss and confusion that threatened to consume him. Yet, out of that darkness emerged a fierce determination to transform his pain into a source of inspiration for others. Through countless hours of reading and self-reflection, Omar discovered that music could be a powerful vehicle for healing, both for himself and for those who resonate with his story. His artistic journey is a testament to resilience, showcasing how one can channel personal hardships into creative expression. By sharing his struggles with mental health, loss, and the pursuit of purpose, Sin Estres aspires to touch the lives of at least one person out there who might need to hear that they are not alone. In a world that often feels isolating, Omar hopes to ignite a spark of hope through his music, proving that even in the depths of despair, there is always a way to rise and inspire others to do the same.
